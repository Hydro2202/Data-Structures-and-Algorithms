Here are all my activities for the 1st semester in **Data Structures and Algorithms** using C++.  
Note: If you encounter any issues with the semifinal code, please install Qt.  
You can download it from the following link: https://www.qt.io/download-dev.  

These activities cover fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.  
For the semifinal project, I used Qt to build a graphical interface, which may require installation to run properly.  
If you need help understanding a specific concept or troubleshooting code, feel free to reach out.  
I hope these resources will be helpful for anyone studying Data Structures and Algorithms with C++.
